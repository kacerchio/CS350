README.txt

* This README file is for Problem (3) and Problem(4) source code of this assignment *

Running the Program:

	- This program was run using the DrJava development environment configured to JDK 6.0_65

All Files:

	Q3A.java -- spawns and runs two threads concurrently and prints the output of the two processes, which are incomprehensible

	Q3B.java -- spawns and runs two threads concurrently and prints the output of the two processes, implementing Dekker's algorithm to make the output more comprehensible

	Q3C.java -- spawns and runs two threads concurrently and prints the output of the two processes, implementing Dekker's algorithm with a prolonged delay for Thread 0

	Q3D.java -- spawns and runs two threads concurrently and prints the output of the two processes, implementing Peterson's algorithm

	Q4.java -- spawns and runs two threads concurrently and prints the output of the two processes, calculating the number of times a thread executes in the busy-waiting while loop. The main function does this experiment 10 times and generates a log file.

	Q4-log.txt -- log file of counter averages generated by Q4.java 

Functions: 

	- run(): constitutes the main entry for thread execution given by this problem

	- delay(): puts a process to sleep for some random time in interval given (i.e. 0-20)

	- main(): spawns and runs two threads concurrently
