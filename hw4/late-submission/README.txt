LATE SUBMISSION

* This README file is for Problem (3) source code of this assignment *

Running the Program:

	- This program was run using Anaconda and the Spyder Python development environment. 
	- You will need the Python math, random, statistics, sys, collections, and enum libraries to run this file
	- Used Python 3.5

All Files:

	hw4_q3.py -- Contains source code for problem 2 of this assignment

	log_q3.txt -- Contains the log data for the simulation generated by hw4_q3.py

Classes: 

	- EventType: an enum class that defines the two event types (i.e. birth and death)

	- Resource: an enum class that defines the three resource types (i.e. CPU, Disk, and network)

	- Event: an object that represents an event with the attributes of arrival time, service start time, service time, and end time

Functions: 

	- exponential(): returns a random value according to an exponential distribution using the built-in Python random function

	- sim_cpu(): handles where an event passed to the CPU should go and generates new events to add to the schedule

	- sim_disk(): handles where an event passed to the Disk should go  

	- sim_net(): handles where an event passed to the Network should go

	- main(): simulates the processing of events throughout the system with different probabilities and service times
